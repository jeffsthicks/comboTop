	\chapter{Odds And Ends}
There is, of course, never enough time to talk about all the topics that one would want to. Here are a few lectures which don't really sit on the main course of the class, but are pleasant explorations in side topics of combinatorial topology. These topics also occurred frequently enough as prerequisite knowledge for a number of projects that it seems like a good idea to include them as short references for projects, or perhaps as samples for what a project should feel like.
