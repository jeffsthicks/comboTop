\begin{exercise}
The graph $K_5$ is not planar. Exhibit a drawing of $K_5$ which is embedded in the torus instead. 
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
The petal graph $\clubsuit_n$ is the graph created by taking $n$ triangles, and identifying from each one a vertex.  Show that for any surface $\Sigma$, there exists $n$ large enough and an embedding of $\clubsuit_n$ into that surface which makes $\clubsuit_n$ a net for that surface. 	
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
Show that every graph embeds into some surface. Try and find a bound for the genus of this surface in terms of the number of edges in the graph. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
 Let $K(g)$ be the size of the largest $K_n$ that can be embedded in a surface of genus $g$. Find functions $K_-(g) \leq K (g) \leq K_+(g)$ so that $K_-(g)-K_+(g) <2 \sqrt{g}$. 
\end{exercise}
